## General
"The Mad Otter" is a roguelike game based on "The Binding of Isaac" mechanics. As befits roguelike games, the game is very difficult. The game was created to:
- better understanding of the JavaFX library
- get better acquainted with the idea of object-oriented programming (creating a simple game engine)
- experiment with mechanics based on simple RNG

## Features
The game contains many interesting mechanics such as:
- randomly generated map based on previously created templates
- basic animation e.g. destruction of blocks
- 15 different weapons like shotgun, rocket launcher, ak47
- time-limited powerups
- 13 various enemies with different behaviours
- 4 floors with different textures
- map and interface

## Technologies Used
- JavaFX 15.0.1
- FXML (SceneBuilder)
